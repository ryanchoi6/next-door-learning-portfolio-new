              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3 font-body">
                Learning is not the transfer of information — it's the construction of understanding through intentional experience. Every student arrives with a unique cognitive architecture, and the educator's role is to design environments where that architecture can expand.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed font-body">
                I believe in the power of beautiful problems: challenges complex enough to require real thinking, open enough to allow creative solutions, and meaningful enough to justify the struggle.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-display text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">How Projects Are Designed</h3>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3 font-body">
                Every project begins with three questions: What is worth understanding? What will students create that makes their understanding visible? And what conditions will maximize both the rigor of the process and the quality of the outcome?
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed font-body">
                Design thinking isn't a unit — it's the operating system. Empathy interviews, rapid prototyping, critique sessions, and iterative refinement are embedded into every project.

              <h3 className="font-display text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">What Makes This Approach Different</h3>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3 font-body">
                Most STEAM programs treat the "A" as decoration. In my classroom, every discipline carries equal weight. An engineering challenge is also a design challenge. A community project is also an empathy exercise.

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed font-body">
                The result: students who don't just know things, but who can do things — who can look at a complex, real-world situation and say, "I know how to start."
